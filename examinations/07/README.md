# Examination 7 - MariaDB installation

To make a dynamic web site, many use an SQL server to store the data for the web site.

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) is an open-source relational SQL database that is good
to use for our purposes.

We can use a similar strategy as with the _nginx_ web server to install this
software onto the correct host(s). Create the playbook `07-mariadb.yml` with this content:

    ---
    - hosts: db
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure MariaDB-server is installed.
          ansible.builtin.package:
            name: mariadb-server
            state: present

# QUESTION A

Make similar changes to this playbook that we did for the _nginx_ server, so that
the `mariadb` service starts automatically at boot, and is started when the playbook
is run.

# QUESTION B

When you have run the playbook above successfully, how can you verify that the `mariadb`
service is started and is running?

Svar:
Jag kontrollerar att tjänsten körs med sudo systemctl status mariadb - och ser active (running)
sudo mysql -u root gör att jag kan ansluta
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 3306 - visar att MariaDB lyssnar på port 3306.

# BONUS QUESTION

How many different ways can use come up with to verify that the `mariadb` service is running?
systemctl is-active mariadb
sudo systemctl status mariadb
sudo mysql -u root
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 3306
pgrep mariadbd
